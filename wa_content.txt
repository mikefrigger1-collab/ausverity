      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Family Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Family law in Western Australia operates under federal legislation including the Family Law Act 1975, with state courts handling specific matters such as violence restraining orders. Western Australia has comprehensive family law resources across Perth and regional centres, with the Federal Circuit and Family Court providing services for families dealing with separation, divorce, and parenting disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Family Law in Western Australia</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian family lawyers handle divorce, property settlements, parenting arrangements, spousal maintenance, and de facto relationship matters. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia operates from Perth (Central Law Courts). Western Australia's Magistrates Court handles family violence restraining orders and violence restraining orders, which frequently intersect with family law proceedings. The state has extensive family law practitioners across metropolitan and regional areas.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Key Areas of Family Law Practice</h3>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Divorce and Separation</h4>
      <p>
        Divorce in Western Australia requires 12 months separation. Separation under one roof is recognized where couples can demonstrate living separately. Western Australian lawyers assist with divorce applications, address service complications including remote service requirements, and handle disputed separation dates. The Federal Circuit and Family Court in Perth processes divorce applications, with most matters proceeding undefended after satisfying the 12-month separation requirement.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Child Custody and Parenting Arrangements</h4>
      <p>
        Parenting matters prioritize children's best interests under the Family Law Act. Western Australia encourages parenting plans negotiated between parents without court intervention. When agreement isn't possible, parenting orders address living arrangements, parenting time, parental responsibility, and child support. Western Australian courts consider children's views, relationship with both parents, family violence history, and the benefit of meaningful relationships. Independent Children's Lawyers are appointed in complex cases.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Property Settlement</h4>
      <p>
        Property settlement involves identifying the asset pool, assessing contributions (financial and non-financial), considering future needs including health and earning capacity, and determining just and equitable division. Perth's property values and Western Australia's mining industry wealth require expert valuations. Superannuation splitting and complex assets including businesses, trusts, and mining interests require specialist legal advice. Western Australian property settlements often involve FIFO workers and remote employment considerations.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">De Facto Relationships</h4>
      <p>
        Western Australia's relationship property laws largely mirror married couple provisions under federal jurisdiction, with state laws also applying under the Family Court Act 1997 (WA). De facto couples in Western Australia have the same family law rights as married couples if the relationship lasted two years or there are children. Western Australia recognizes same-sex de facto relationships. Evidence requirements include cohabitation, financial interdependence, sexual relationship, and social recognition.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Family Violence Restraining Orders</h4>
      <p>
        Western Australia's Restraining Orders Act 1997 provides for family violence restraining orders (FVROs) and violence restraining orders (VROs) through Magistrates' Courts. FVROs protect family members from family violence including physical, sexual, psychological, and economic abuse. Police can apply for restraining orders and issue police orders. Breaching a restraining order is a criminal offence. Western Australia has comprehensive family violence support services. Legal aid is available for restraining order matters.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Criminal Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Criminal law in Western Australia operates under the Criminal Code Act Compilation Act 1913, one of Australia's oldest criminal codes. Western Australia has a comprehensive criminal justice system from the Magistrates Court through to the District Court and Supreme Court. If you're facing criminal charges in Western Australia, experienced legal representation is essential to protect your rights and achieve the best possible outcome.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Western Australian Criminal Law</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian criminal lawyers defend clients charged with offences ranging from traffic matters to serious indictable crimes. The Magistrates Court handles summary offences and committal proceedings. The District Court hears most indictable offences including drug trafficking, serious assaults, and armed robbery. The Supreme Court deals with murder, manslaughter, and complex serious crimes. Western Australia's criminal justice system includes rehabilitation programs and therapeutic courts.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Criminal Matters</h3>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Drink Driving and Traffic Offences</h4>
      <p>
        Western Australia has strict drink driving laws with immediate licence disqualifications. Offences include exceeding .05 blood alcohol concentration (.08 for prescribed offence), driving under the influence, and drug driving. Loss of licence mandatory minimum periods apply. Dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm carries substantial imprisonment. Extraordinary licence applications allow limited driving for work or hardship. Traffic lawyers challenge testing procedures, apply for extraordinary licences, and minimize penalties.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Assault and Violence Offences</h4>
      <p>
        Western Australian assault charges include common assault, assault causing bodily harm, assault occasioning bodily harm, and grievous bodily harm. Aggravated offences (circumstances of aggravation) carry enhanced penalties including domestic violence, weapons, and vulnerable victims. One-punch laws under section 281 create special offences for assaults causing death. Self-defence under section 248 Criminal Code requires reasonable belief that force was necessary. Western Australian courts consider rehabilitation prospects in sentencing.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Drug Offences</h4>
      <p>
        Western Australian drug offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 include possession, possession with intent to sell or supply, selling or supplying, and cultivation. Trafficking presumptions apply above specified quantities. Western Australia's Cannabis Intervention Requirement diverts minor cannabis offenders to education sessions. The Drug Court provides intensive supervision and treatment for eligible offenders. Drug lawyers challenge search legality, contest trafficking presumptions, and pursue diversion or treatment options.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Fraud and White Collar Crime</h4>
      <p>
        Fraud in Western Australia includes stealing, fraud offences, and dishonest dealings under the Criminal Code. WA Police's Fraud Squad investigates serious matters. Corporate fraud, ASIC prosecutions, and Centrelink fraud are common. Mining and resources sector fraud occurs given Western Australia's industry profile. Western Australian courts consider restitution and cooperation in sentencing. Complex fraud requires specialist defence lawyers who understand financial transactions.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Sexual Offences</h4>
      <p>
        Sexual assault offences in Western Australia carry maximum penalties up to life imprisonment for aggravated sexual penetration. Child sexual abuse offences are prosecuted extensively. Complainant evidence can be given via CCTV or recorded statements. Sexual assault counselling privilege protects confidential communications. Historical sexual assault prosecutions are common. Specialist criminal lawyers experienced in sexual offence trials are essential for proper defence.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Your Rights When Charged</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian law protects accused persons' rights. You have the right to silence, the right to contact a lawyer before police interview, and the right to refuse participation in identification procedures. Police must caution you before interview. Record of interview procedures must be followed. You're not required to provide anything beyond identifying information. Legal Aid WA provides duty lawyer services at police stations and courts.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Court Process in Western Australia</h3>
      <p>
        Most criminal matters start at the Magistrates Court. Summary offences are finalized there. Indictable offences proceed to committal hearings testing the prosecution case before trial at District or Supreme Court. Western Australia's Pre-Sentence Order scheme allows assessment and treatment before sentencing. Plea hearings involve detailed submissions on sentencing factors including rehabilitation prospects. Western Australian courts emphasize restorative justice where appropriate.

Penalties include conditional release orders, fines, community based orders, intensive supervision orders, conditional suspended imprisonment, and imprisonment. Guilty plea discounts apply for early pleas. Western Australia's mandatory sentencing provisions apply to certain offences including third-strike burglary and assaults on police.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Property Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Property law in Western Australia operates under the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (Torrens Title system), Settlement Agents Act 1981, and numerous other statutes. Perth's property market is active, with Western Australia's property transactions involving specific legal requirements. Western Australian property lawyers and settlement agents ensure smooth conveyancing, protect your interests, and navigate the state's unique property law framework.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Conveyancing in Western Australia</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian conveyancing involves contract exchange, cooling-off period (generally not applicable for most contracts), building and pest inspections, settlement, and registration through Landgate. Vendor disclosure requirements are less prescriptive than eastern states. Electronic conveyancing through PEXA operates in Western Australia. Stamp duty (transfer duty) applies with various concessions available. Searches reveal council rates, planning restrictions, and title encumbrances. Settlement agents conduct most residential conveyancing in Western Australia.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Residential Property Transactions</h3>
      <p>
        Buying property in Western Australia typically uses the standard REIWA (Real Estate Institute of Western Australia) contract. Building inspections are strongly recommended but not mandatory. Most residential contracts don't provide cooling-off rights (except off-the-plan purchases). Perth's property market requires expert advice on contract negotiation. First home buyers can access stamp duty concessions and grants for properties meeting eligibility criteria.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">First Home Buyers in Western Australia</h4>
      <p>
        Western Australia offers first home buyer concessions including stamp duty rebates for properties up to certain values. The First Home Owner Grant provides funds for newly built homes. Off-the-plan purchases provide additional benefits. Regional Western Australia may have additional incentives. Settlement agents and property lawyers ensure you receive all available concessions and proper contract protections.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Commercial Property</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian commercial property transactions involve complex due diligence on leases, environmental issues, GST, and business operations. Commercial contracts require careful negotiation. Lease assignments require landlord consent under common law and lease terms. Perth CBD commercial property has unique considerations including resource sector tenant demand and development potential. Commercial property lawyers conduct comprehensive due diligence and negotiate favorable terms.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Leasing and Tenancy</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's Residential Tenancies Act 1987 governs residential tenancies. The Magistrates Court resolves tenancy disputes including bond claims, repairs, and termination. Reforms provide tenant protections including limits on rent increases and restrictions on evictions without grounds. Commercial leases are governed by common law and the Commercial Tenancy (Retail Shops) Agreements Act 1985 for retail premises requiring disclosure and minimum lease terms.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Strata and Community Titles</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's Strata Titles Act 1985 governs apartments and townhouses. Strata companies manage common property, levy collection, and by-law enforcement. Strata information certificates disclose financial position, by-laws, major works, and disputes. Building defects in new developments are addressed through builders' registration requirements and statutory warranties under the Home Building Contracts Act 1991. The State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) resolves strata disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Property Development</h3>
      <p>
        Property development in Western Australia requires development approval under the Planning and Development Act 2005. Local governments assess development applications against local planning schemes. The Development Assessment Panels assess larger applications. The State Administrative Tribunal hears planning appeals. Environmental considerations may require environmental impact assessments. Development contribution plans and infrastructure contributions apply to larger developments. Planning lawyers coordinate applications, appeals, and compliance.

SAT provides accessible resolution for tenancy, strata, and retail tenancy disputes. The Magistrates Court, District Court, and Supreme Court handle property litigation depending on value and complexity. Fencing disputes are resolved under the Dividing Fences Act 1961.

  'wills-estates': (

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Wills and Estates Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Wills and estates law in Western Australia is governed by the Wills Act 1970, Administration Act 1903, and Guardianship and Administration Act 1990. Proper estate planning protects your assets, provides for loved ones, and minimizes disputes. Western Australian wills and estates lawyers provide comprehensive advice on succession planning, estate administration, and contesting wills.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Will Drafting in Western Australia</h3>
      <p>
        A valid Western Australian will must be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by two independent witnesses who sign in the testator's presence. Informal wills can be admitted to probate in limited circumstances under section 37 Wills Act. Professional will drafting addresses blended families, business succession, asset protection, and tax planning. Testamentary trusts protect beneficiaries from bankruptcy, relationship breakdowns, and provide tax benefits. Regular reviews ensure wills reflect changed circumstances.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Estate Planning Strategies</h3>
      <p>
        Comprehensive estate planning in Western Australia includes wills, enduring powers of attorney, enduring powers of guardianship, and superannuation binding death benefit nominations. Proper planning minimizes family provision claims, provides for disabled beneficiaries through special disability trusts, and structures inheritances for asset protection. Perth's property values and mining industry wealth make estate planning particularly important for managing wealth transfer and tax efficiency.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Probate and Estate Administration</h3>
      <p>
        Probate is the Supreme Court's grant of representation to executors. Western Australian executors must collect assets, pay debts, lodge tax returns, and distribute to beneficiaries according to the will. Small estates under certain thresholds may not require formal probate. The process involves obtaining death certificate, locating the will, identifying assets and liabilities, obtaining valuations, and preparing estate accounts. Lawyers ensure executors comply with duties and protect against personal liability.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Intestacy in Western Australia</h4>
      <p>
        When someone dies without a valid will, intestacy rules under Part III Administration Act determine distribution. Spouses receive priority with provisions for children. The intestacy formula considers family composition. De facto partners have the same rights as married spouses. The Public Trustee may be appointed administrator if no family applies. Intestacy often results in unintended outcomes and family disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Contesting Wills and Family Provision Claims</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's family provision regime under Part III Inheritance (Family and Dependants Provision) Act 1972 allows eligible persons to apply for greater provision from an estate. Eligible persons include spouses, children (including adult children), domestic partners, and certain dependents. Applications must be filed within six months of probate grant. Western Australian courts consider financial resources, health, relationship with deceased, contributions, and provision made. Successful claims significantly alter distributions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Powers of Attorney</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia recognizes enduring powers of attorney (financial and legal matters) under the Guardianship and Administration Act 1990. Enduring powers must be properly executed with prescribed witnesses and continue after loss of capacity. Attorneys must act in the principal's best interests, keep proper accounts, and avoid conflicts of interest. SAT reviews attorney conduct and suspected financial abuse. Registration may be required with Landgate for property transactions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Enduring Powers of Guardianship</h3>
      <p>
        Enduring powers of guardianship under the Guardianship and Administration Act allow appointed persons to make personal, lifestyle, and treatment decisions if you lose capacity. Appointments must be witnessed by authorized witnesses. Advance health directives document your medical treatment preferences. SAT's Guardianship and Administration jurisdiction can appoint guardians for personal decisions if you lose capacity without valid appointments.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Employment Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Employment law in Western Australia operates primarily under federal legislation including the Fair Work Act 2009, with state-based workers compensation and workplace safety laws. Western Australia has extensive employment law resources including the Fair Work Commission, WorkCover WA, and the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety. Employment lawyers protect employee and employer rights in this complex regulatory environment.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Employment Law in Western Australia</h3>
      <p>
        Most Western Australian employment matters fall under the federal Fair Work system covering minimum wages, working conditions, unfair dismissal, and general protections. However, Western Australian state laws govern workers compensation under the Workers' Compensation and Injury Management Act 1981, workplace safety under the Work Health and Safety Act 2020, and certain state public sector employment under the Public Sector Management Act 1994. The State Administrative Tribunal handles some employment disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Unfair Dismissal Claims</h3>
      <p>
        Employees dismissed from employment may file unfair dismissal applications with the Fair Work Commission if they've served the minimum employment period (six months for small businesses, 12 months otherwise) and earn below the high income threshold. Applications must be lodged within 21 days of dismissal. Western Australian employment lawyers assess dismissal fairness, prepare applications, and represent clients at conciliation conferences and hearings. Remedies include reinstatement or compensation up to six months' wages.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">General Protections Claims</h4>
      <p>
        General protections prohibit adverse action for exercising workplace rights, union membership, discrimination, or sham contracting. These claims have 60-day time limits but can result in uncapped compensation. Western Australia has significant case law on general protections particularly regarding FIFO employment and mining industry disputes. Anti-bullying applications can be made to Fair Work Commission while still employed.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Workplace Discrimination and Harassment</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's Equal Opportunity Act 1984 prohibits discrimination based on protected attributes including sex, race, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy, and family responsibility. The Equal Opportunity Commission investigates complaints and attempts conciliation. Unresolved matters proceed to SAT. Sexual harassment reforms have strengthened protections and employer obligations.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Employment Contracts and Agreements</h3>
      <p>
        Employment lawyers review and draft employment contracts, executive service agreements, FIFO rosters and agreements, restraint of trade clauses, confidentiality agreements, and enterprise agreements. Western Australian courts have developed case law on restraint of trade enforceability, requiring restraints to protect legitimate business interests and be reasonable. Post-employment restraints are frequently litigated, particularly in mining and resources sectors.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Workers' Compensation</h3>
      <p>
        WorkCover WA administers workers compensation for Western Australian workers. Claims cover medical expenses, weekly payments, and permanent impairment benefits. Common law claims are not available in Western Australia - the workers compensation scheme provides exclusive remedy. Time limits apply - workers compensation claims should be lodged promptly. Lawyers ensure maximum statutory entitlements and navigate the WorkCover system.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Redundancy and Restructuring</h3>
      <p>
        Genuine redundancy requires the position to no longer exist. Large-scale redundancies may require consultation under Fair Work Act provisions. Redundancy pay depends on years of service. Western Australian employees can challenge sham redundancies or unfair selection processes. Mining and resources sector downturns create significant redundancy issues. Employment lawyers ensure proper processes and maximum entitlements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Workplace Safety and Bullying</h3>
      <p>
        WorkSafe WA enforces Western Australia's Work Health and Safety Act 2020, including psychosocial hazards and workplace bullying. Western Australian employers must provide safe systems of work and address workplace bullying. The Fair Work Commission handles workplace bullying applications. Workers compensation claims for psychological injury from workplace bullying are common. Employment lawyers advise on prevention, responding to complaints, and defending claims.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Personal Injury Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Personal injury law in Western Australia helps victims of accidents and negligence obtain compensation. Western Australia operates comprehensive compensation schemes including compulsory third party (CTP) insurance for motor accidents, WorkCover WA for workplace injuries, and common law claims for public liability and medical negligence. Experienced Western Australian personal injury lawyers navigate these schemes to maximize your compensation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Motor Vehicle Accidents</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's compulsory third party (CTP) insurance scheme provides compensation for injuries in motor accidents. Claims are made against the at-fault driver's CTP insurer under common law principles. Damages include medical expenses, loss of earnings, future care, pain and suffering, and economic loss. The Motor Vehicle (Catastrophic Injuries) Act 2016 provides no-fault catastrophic injury cover for severe injuries. Claims must be lodged within three years. Pre-litigation procedures including offers to settle are required.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">CTP Claims Process</h4>
      <p>
        CTP claims involve notifying the insurer, gathering medical evidence, establishing liability, and negotiating settlement or proceeding to court. Western Australia's fault-based system requires proving negligence. Personal injury lawyers conduct thorough investigations, obtain expert evidence, and maximize compensation. The District Court hears most CTP claims, with Supreme Court handling high-value matters.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Medical Negligence</h3>
      <p>
        Medical negligence claims in Western Australia arise from substandard medical care causing injury. This includes misdiagnosis, surgical errors, medication mistakes, birth injuries, and failure to obtain informed consent. Public hospitals are covered by the Department of Health, while private practitioners have professional indemnity insurance. The Civil Liability Act 2002 governs liability and damages. Expert medical evidence is essential. Time limits are generally three years from awareness of negligence.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Public Liability Claims</h3>
      <p>
        Public liability claims compensate injuries on another person's property or due to their negligence. Common claims include slip and fall in shopping centres, local government property injuries, dog attacks, and defective products. Western Australia's Civil Liability Act 2002 requires proving breach of duty of care and causation. Contributory negligence reduces compensation if you were partly at fault. Dangerous recreational activities may have limited liability. Personal injury lawyers investigate liability and negotiate with insurers.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Workers Compensation Claims</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian workers injured at work claim workers compensation through WorkCover WA for medical expenses, weekly payments, and permanent impairment benefits. Western Australia does not allow common law damages claims - the workers compensation scheme provides exclusive remedy. Redemptions (lump sum settlements) are available in limited circumstances. Time limits are strict - workers compensation claims should be lodged immediately. Specialist lawyers ensure maximum statutory entitlements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Total and Permanent Disability (TPD)</h3>
      <p>
        TPD insurance, typically held through superannuation, pays lump sum benefits when unable to work due to injury or illness. Western Australian TPD claims are common, with insurers frequently denying legitimate claims. Disputes involve medical evidence, policy interpretation, and TPD definitions. The Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) handles complaints. TPD lawyers represent claimants through the claims and appeals process.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Dust Diseases and Asbestos</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian workers exposed to asbestos, silica, or other harmful dusts can develop serious diseases decades later. Asbestos-related diseases including mesothelioma, asbestosis, and asbestos-related lung cancer have special compensation provisions. WorkCover WA administers workers compensation for dust diseases. Common law claims against former employers (where available) and asbestos product manufacturers provide additional compensation. Time limits are extended due to long latency periods. Specialist asbestos lawyers trace exposure history.

      <p>
        Personal injury disputes in Western Australia are often resolved through negotiation, mediation, or pre-trial conferences. The District Court and Supreme Court hear personal injury litigation. Mediation is encouraged before trial. Workers compensation disputes proceed through conciliation and arbitration. Medical panels determine impairment assessments. Personal injury lawyers guide clients through dispute resolution processes.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Business Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Business law in Western Australia encompasses corporate law, commercial contracts, mergers and acquisitions, and regulatory compliance. Perth is an important business centre with strong mining, resources, energy, and agricultural sectors. Western Australian business lawyers advise on business formation, operations, transactions, and disputes to help businesses succeed while managing legal risks.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Business Formation and Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Choosing the right business structure is crucial. Options include sole trader, partnership, trust, or company. Companies are regulated by ASIC under the Corporations Act 2001. Western Australian lawyers advise on tax implications, asset protection, liability, succession planning, and compliance requirements. Company incorporation involves registration with ASIC, constitution drafting, shareholder agreements, and compliance frameworks. Family businesses and resource sector ventures often use trust structures.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Commercial Contracts</h3>
      <p>
        Commercial contracts underpin Western Australian businesses. Common contracts include supply agreements, distribution agreements, service agreements, licensing, franchise agreements, joint ventures, and mining services contracts. Western Australian contract law requires offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention. The Australian Consumer Law imposes mandatory guarantees and unfair contract term prohibitions. Lawyers draft, review, and negotiate contracts protecting your business interests and ensuring enforceability.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Franchising</h4>
      <p>
        Franchising in Western Australia is regulated by the Franchising Code of Conduct requiring comprehensive disclosure before franchise sale. Franchisors must provide disclosure documents, financial information, and cooling-off periods. Western Australian franchise disputes include misleading conduct, breach of franchise agreements, and goodwill claims. The Federal Court and Supreme Court hear franchise matters. Specialist franchise lawyers represent franchisors and franchisees in disputes and transactions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mergers and Acquisitions</h3>
      <p>
        Business acquisitions in Western Australia involve due diligence, contract negotiation, regulatory approvals, and completion. Due diligence examines financial records, contracts, litigation, intellectual property, employment, and tax. Mining and resources sector acquisitions require specialized due diligence on tenements, environmental compliance, and native title. Share sales transfer ownership of the company entity. Asset sales transfer specific business assets. Corporate lawyers coordinate complex acquisitions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Partnership and Shareholder Agreements</h3>
      <p>
        Partnership agreements govern business partnerships under the Partnership Act 1895 (WA). Shareholder agreements regulate relationships between company shareholders addressing management, share transfers, dispute resolution, and exit strategies. Buy-sell provisions, drag-along and tag-along rights, and valuation mechanisms prevent deadlocks. Western Australian courts handle partnership and shareholder disputes including oppression claims under section 232 Corporations Act. Proper agreements prevent costly disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Commercial Disputes</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian businesses face disputes including contract breaches, partnership disputes, shareholder disputes, trade practices claims, and debt recovery. SAT handles smaller commercial matters. District Court and Supreme Court hear larger disputes. Mediation and arbitration provide alternatives to litigation. Mining and resources sector disputes are common. Business lawyers resolve disputes efficiently through negotiation, alternative dispute resolution, or court proceedings when necessary.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Immigration Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Immigration law in Western Australia operates under federal legislation including the Migration Act 1958 and Migration Regulations. Perth attracts skilled migrants, international students, family migrants, and business migrants. Western Australia's state nomination program provides pathways to permanent residence. Registered migration agents and immigration lawyers guide applicants through complex visa processes and represent clients in tribunals and courts.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Visa Categories</h3>
      <p>
        Australia's visa system includes temporary visas (visitor, student, temporary work) and permanent visas (skilled, family, business). Western Australia's state nomination program for skilled migrants targets occupations in demand including healthcare, engineering, IT, trades, and mining professionals. Perth and regional Western Australia offer different migration pathways. Visa applications require meeting health, character, and specific visa criteria. Processing times vary significantly by visa type and applicant circumstances.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Skilled Migration</h4>
      <p>
        Skilled migration to Western Australia includes independent skilled visas, state-nominated visas, and employer-sponsored visas. Western Australia's state nomination program provides pathways for occupations on the state's skilled occupation list. Points-tested visas require meeting points threshold through age, English, qualifications, and work experience. Regional Western Australia (outside Perth) offers additional migration pathways with lower requirements. Mining and resources sector skills are in demand.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Family Migration</h3>
      <p>
        Partner visas allow Australian citizens, permanent residents, and eligible New Zealand citizens to sponsor spouses and de facto partners. Prospective marriage visas require intent to marry within nine months. Parent visas have long waiting periods with contributory options providing faster processing. Child visas and remaining relative visas complete family migration categories. Western Australia's multicultural population makes family reunification common.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Business and Investment Migration</h3>
      <p>
        Business Innovation and Investment visas attract entrepreneurs and investors to Western Australia. The Business Innovation stream requires successful business experience and genuine intention to operate Western Australian business. Investor streams require designated investments in Australian assets. Western Australia's state nomination program prioritizes genuine business establishment in growth sectors including technology, agriculture, and resources services. Business advisers assist migrant entrepreneurs.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Student Visas</h3>
      <p>
        Perth's universities and colleges attract international students. Student visas require enrollment in registered courses, sufficient funds, health insurance, and genuine temporary entrant requirements. Post-study work visas allow graduates to gain Australian work experience. Regional classification may provide additional visa benefits. Visa conditions restrict work hours during studies. Education agents and migration lawyers assist with visa applications and compliance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Citizenship</h3>
      <p>
        Australian citizenship requires permanent residence, residency period (usually four years including 12 months as permanent resident), good character, and knowledge of Australia. Citizenship confers voting rights, passport eligibility, and government employment access. Children born in Australia to permanent residents or citizens are usually Australian citizens. Citizenship by descent applies to children born overseas to Australian citizen parents.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Visa Refusals and Cancellations</h3>
      <p>
        Visa refusals and cancellations can be reviewed by the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART, formerly AAT). Character cancellations under section 501 Migration Act affect visa holders with criminal records. Direction 99 guides decision-makers on character cancellations considering family ties and community protection. Federal Circuit and Family Court and Federal Court hear judicial review applications. Immigration lawyers represent clients in tribunal and court proceedings.

Pre-action protocols encourage early resolution. Discovery, expert evidence, and interlocutory applications require compliance with rules and practice directions.
      </p>

  'bankruptcy-insolvency': (

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Bankruptcy and Insolvency in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Bankruptcy and insolvency law in Western Australia helps individuals and companies facing financial difficulties. The Bankruptcy Act 1966 governs personal insolvency, while the Corporations Act 2001 governs corporate insolvency. Western Australia has experienced insolvency practitioners and lawyers who advise on bankruptcy alternatives, restructuring, and formal insolvency processes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Personal Bankruptcy</h3>
      <p>
        Bankruptcy is a formal process where an individual is declared unable to pay debts. Bankruptcy can be voluntary (debtor's petition) or involuntary (creditor's petition). A trustee takes control of assets, realizes them, and distributes to creditors. Bankruptcy typically lasts three years. During bankruptcy, travel restrictions apply, credit reporting continues for five years, and certain assets are protected including household items, tools of trade, and some superannuation. Bankruptcy discharges most debts excluding child support, HECS, and fraud debts.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Alternatives to Bankruptcy</h4>
      <p>
        Debt agreements under Part IX Bankruptcy Act allow debtors to propose reduced payment arrangements to creditors avoiding bankruptcy. Personal insolvency agreements (Part X) provide flexible arrangements for higher-value estates. Informal arrangements negotiate payment plans with creditors. These alternatives avoid bankruptcy's consequences while addressing debt. Western Australian insolvency practitioners assess options and implement solutions. Early advice maximizes options and prevents forced bankruptcy.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Corporate Insolvency</h3>
      <p>
        Companies facing insolvency have several options. Voluntary administration under Part 5.3A Corporations Act provides breathing space while administrators investigate rescue prospects. Creditors vote on proposals including deeds of company arrangement. Liquidation winds up companies and distributes assets to creditors. Receivers can be appointed by secured creditors. Directors facing insolvent trading allegations face personal liability. Mining and resources sector volatility creates insolvency issues. Early advice prevents wrongful trading and maximizes restructuring options.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Liquidation</h3>
      <p>
        Liquidation ends company existence through voluntary liquidation (members' or creditors') or court-ordered winding up. Liquidators realize assets, investigate company affairs, and distribute to creditors according to priority. Employees rank ahead of unsecured creditors for wages and entitlements. Liquidators pursue voidable transactions including unfair preferences and uncommercial transactions. ASIC regulates liquidators. Creditors receive dividends if assets remain after secured and priority creditors.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Voluntary Administration</h3>
      <p>
        Voluntary administration provides companies with temporary protection from creditors while exploring rescue options. Administrators investigate company affairs and report to creditors on prospects of saving business. Creditors vote on proposals including deeds of company arrangement, liquidation, or returning company to directors. Western Australian administrators work with directors, creditors, and employees to achieve optimal outcomes. Administration can result in successful restructuring saving businesses and jobs.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Creditors' Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Creditors can initiate bankruptcy or winding up proceedings to recover debts. Statutory demands under section 459E Corporations Act require companies to pay debts or face presumed insolvency. Creditors lodge proofs of debt in administrations and liquidations. Committees of inspection represent creditor interests. Creditors can challenge administrators' and liquidators' decisions. Security interests under the Personal Property Securities Act provide priority. Insolvency lawyers represent creditors maximizing recoveries.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Directors' Duties and Insolvent Trading</h3>
      <p>
        Directors must prevent insolvent trading - incurring debts when company cannot pay them. Section 588G Corporations Act imposes personal liability on directors for insolvent trading. Safe harbour protections apply when directors develop and implement restructuring plans. The business judgment rule protects informed, good faith decisions. ASIC prosecutes serious director breaches. Western Australian insolvency lawyers advise directors on duties, safe harbour, and defending claims.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Intellectual Property Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Intellectual property law protects creations of the mind including inventions, brands, designs, and creative works. Western Australia's innovation economy, particularly in mining technology, resources technology, agricultural innovation, and creative sectors, makes IP protection essential. Western Australian IP lawyers advise on registration, protection, commercialization, and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Trademarks</h3>
      <p>
        Trademarks protect brand names, logos, and other identifiers under the Trade Marks Act 1995. Registration with IP Australia provides exclusive rights to use marks for registered goods and services. Western Australian businesses should conduct searches before adoption, register in relevant classes, and monitor for infringement. Trademark protection prevents consumer confusion and protects brand investment. Opposition and cancellation proceedings defend trademark rights. Lawyers advise on selection, registration, and enforcement.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Copyright</h3>
      <p>
        Copyright automatically protects original works including literary works, artistic works, music, films, sound recordings, and broadcasts under the Copyright Act 1968. Protection lasts life of author plus 70 years. Copyright protects expression, not ideas. Fair dealing exceptions allow limited use for research, criticism, and news reporting. Digital copyright issues are increasingly important. Copyright assignment and licensing agreements commercialize works. Infringement remedies include damages, accounts of profits, and injunctions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Patents</h3>
      <p>
        Patents protect inventions that are novel, inventive, and useful under the Patents Act 1990. Standard patents last 20 years; innovation patents (abolished 2021 for new applications) lasted 8 years. The patent process involves search, application, examination, and grant. Provisional applications establish priority for 12 months. Western Australian innovation in mining technology, automation, agricultural technology, and marine technology generates significant patent activity. Patent lawyers conduct searches, draft specifications, prosecute applications, and enforce patents.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Designs</h3>
      <p>
        Registered designs protect visual appearance of products including shape, configuration, pattern, and ornamentation under the Designs Act 2003. Protection lasts up to 10 years. Designs must be new and distinctive. Registration is relatively quick and affordable. Product designers and manufacturers should register designs before public disclosure. Design infringement involves making, importing, or selling products embodying registered designs. Western Australian product design industries benefit from design protection.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</h3>
      <p>
        Trade secrets protect confidential business information including formulas, processes, customer lists, and know-how. Unlike registered IP rights, trade secrets rely on maintaining secrecy. Breach of confidence claims prevent unauthorized disclosure or use. Employment contracts and non-disclosure agreements protect confidential information. Mining technology and resources sector innovations often rely on trade secret protection. Western Australian courts grant injunctions preventing disclosure and damages for breaches.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">IP Commercialization</h3>
      <p>
        IP commercialization includes licensing, assignment, and joint ventures. Licensing agreements grant rights to use IP while retaining ownership. Exclusive licenses provide sole licensee rights; non-exclusive licenses permit multiple licensees. Royalty structures compensate IP owners. Due diligence examines IP ownership and validity. R&D tax incentives support Western Australian innovation. IP lawyers negotiate and draft commercialization agreements maximizing value while protecting rights.

Australian Border Force can seize counterfeit imports. Anton Piller orders (search orders) preserve evidence. Cease and desist letters often resolve matters without litigation. Western Australian IP owners should actively monitor and enforce rights. Lawyers advise on infringement, conduct negotiations, and litigate when necessary.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Tax Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Tax law in Western Australia encompasses federal taxation administered by the Australian Taxation Office and state taxes administered by the Department of Finance. Western Australian tax lawyers advise individuals and businesses on tax planning, compliance, disputes, and restructuring to minimize tax liabilities and resolve ATO disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Income Tax</h3>
      <p>
        Income tax applies to individuals, companies, trusts, and superannuation funds under federal tax law. Western Australian taxpayers face the same income tax rates as other Australians. Tax planning includes structuring income, maximizing deductions, timing transactions, and utilizing concessions. Small business CGT concessions provide significant relief for business asset sales. Mining and resources sector taxation involves specific considerations. Tax lawyers advise on complex transactions, restructures, and ATO audits.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Goods and Services Tax (GST)</h4>
      <p>
        GST at 10% applies to most supplies of goods and services. Businesses with turnover over $75,000 ($150,000 for non-profits) must register. Input tax credits allow GST-registered businesses to claim back GST on purchases. GST-free supplies include basic food, health, and education. Complex GST issues arise in property transactions, financial supplies, mining operations, and margin schemes. Tax advisers ensure GST compliance and optimal structuring.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">State Taxes - Transfer Duty and Land Tax</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia imposes transfer duty (stamp duty) on property transfers, business asset sales, motor vehicle transfers, and insurance. Rates vary by transaction type. Property transfer duty uses progressive rates with first home buyer concessions. Land tax applies annually to Western Australian land holdings above thresholds with aggregation rules. Principal place of residence exemption excludes main homes. Primary production land has exemptions. Department of Finance administers these taxes with objection and appeal rights to SAT.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Payroll Tax</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian employers with Australian wages exceeding the threshold ($1 million for 2023-24) pay payroll tax at 5.5%. Regional employers receive rate reductions. Grouping provisions aggregate related businesses' wages. Contractors may be deemed employees for payroll tax. Department of Finance audits ensure compliance. Voluntary disclosures provide penalty relief. Tax lawyers advise on payroll tax obligations, grouping, and disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tax Disputes and Audits</h3>
      <p>
        ATO audits examine tax returns for compliance. Taxpayers have rights including representation and reasonable time to respond. Objections challenge ATO decisions with 60-day time limits (four years for small businesses). The Administrative Review Tribunal reviews objection decisions. Federal Court hears appeals on questions of law. Western Australian taxpayers frequently dispute Part IVA general anti-avoidance provisions, transfer pricing, and thin capitalization. Tax lawyers represent clients in audits, objections, and litigation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tax Planning and Restructuring</h3>
      <p>
        Tax planning minimizes tax within legal boundaries. Common strategies include income splitting through family trusts, superannuation contributions, negative gearing, and asset protection structures. Business restructures utilize rollover provisions avoiding immediate tax. Mining and resources businesses have specific tax planning opportunities including immediate deductibility of exploration expenditure. Voluntary disclosures to ATO reduce penalties for past non-compliance. Tax lawyers design compliant structures achieving tax efficiency.

        Superannuation enjoys concessional tax treatment to encourage retirement savings. Contributions are taxed at 15% (30% for high earners). Earnings taxed at 15% in accumulation phase, tax-free in pension phase. Superannuation death benefits have tax implications depending on beneficiary and payment type. Self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) require careful administration and compliance. Western Australian SMSF trustees face auditor and ATO scrutiny. Tax advisers optimize superannuation strategies.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Environmental Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Environmental law in Western Australia regulates environmental protection, land use planning, and natural resource management. The Environmental Protection Act 1986 provides Western Australia's environmental framework with the Environmental Protection Authority as principal regulator. Western Australian environmental lawyers advise on compliance, planning, contaminated land, mining approvals, and environmental litigation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Environment Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's Environmental Protection Act 1986 requires proponents not to cause environmental harm. The EPA assesses significant proposals and provides environmental impact assessments. Ministerial approval required for clearing native vegetation and prescribed premises require licenses. Pollution must be controlled and reported. EPA can issue directions, environmental protection notices, and prosecutions. Mining and resources projects undergo rigorous environmental assessment. Environmental lawyers advise on approvals, compliance, and respond to EPA action.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Planning and Development</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's Planning and Development Act 2005 regulates land use and development. Local planning schemes control development through zones and provisions. Development approval required for most development. Local governments, Development Assessment Panels, or WAPC assess applications. The State Administrative Tribunal hears planning appeals. Major projects can access streamlined state assessment. Environmental impact assessments integrate with planning. Planning lawyers obtain approvals, defend objections, and appeal decisions.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Contaminated Land</h4>
      <p>
        Contaminated land creates liability for current and former owners, occupiers, and polluters under the Contaminated Sites Act 2003. Department of Water and Environmental Regulation maintains contaminated sites database. Site classification and remediation required for contaminated sites. Auditors certify remediation. Due diligence investigations identify contamination risks. Mining and industrial legacy creates contamination issues. Environmental lawyers advise purchasers, vendors, and responsible parties on contaminated land issues.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Native Title and Cultural Heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Native title recognizes Indigenous rights to traditional lands. Native title claims in Western Australia are extensive and determined by Federal Court. The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 protects Aboriginal heritage sites. Section 18 approvals required to impact Aboriginal heritage. Heritage surveys and consultations with traditional owners are required for development. Unauthorized damage to Aboriginal heritage is an offence. Developers engage with traditional owner groups and obtain heritage approvals.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mining and Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Mining in Western Australia requires tenements under the Mining Act 1978 and approvals under environmental and heritage legislation. Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety administers mining tenements. Mining proposals require environmental approvals, mine closure plans, and financial assurances. Western Australia's iron ore, gold, nickel, lithium, and LNG industries are globally significant. Native title and heritage approvals are critical. Mining lawyers obtain approvals and advise on compliance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Climate Change and Renewable Energy</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia has renewable energy targets with significant solar and wind development. No standalone climate change legislation exists but carbon considerations affect project approvals. Offshore wind potential is being developed. Environmental approvals consider greenhouse gas emissions. National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting requires emissions reporting. Environmental lawyers advise on renewable energy projects and regulatory compliance.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Administrative Law in Western Australia</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Administrative law in Western Australia governs the exercise of government power and review of government decisions. The State Administrative Tribunal (SAT), Ombudsman Western Australia, and courts review administrative action. Administrative lawyers challenge unlawful decisions, ensure procedural fairness, and hold government accountable to the rule of law.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">SAT Review</h3>
      <p>
        SAT reviews state government decisions across diverse areas including planning, building, tenancy, guardianship, occupational regulation, commercial tenancy, and mining warden appeals. SAT provides accessible, low-cost review with less formality than courts. The enabling Act for each decision specifies review rights and grounds. SAT conducts hearings de novo or on review basis depending on jurisdiction. Lawyers represent parties in SAT proceedings, ensuring procedural rights and presenting persuasive cases.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Judicial Review</h3>
      <p>
        Judicial review challenges government decisions on legal grounds including jurisdictional error, procedural unfairness, taking irrelevant considerations into account, failing to consider relevant matters, and unreasonableness. The Supreme Court's judicial review jurisdiction covers Western Australian government decisions. Federal Court reviews Commonwealth decisions. Judicial review doesn't substitute decision-maker's discretion but ensures lawful exercise. Remedies include quashing decisions, mandamus compelling action, and declarations.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Procedural Fairness</h4>
      <p>
        Procedural fairness (natural justice) requires fair hearing and unbiased decision-makers. The hearing rule requires notice, opportunity to be heard, and consideration of submissions. The bias rule requires actual or apprehended freedom from bias. Western Australian decision-makers must comply unless legislation clearly excludes fairness. Lawyers challenge decisions lacking procedural fairness and advise government on compliance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Ombudsman Western Australia</h3>
      <p>
        Ombudsman Western Australia investigates complaints about Western Australian government agencies, local governments, universities, and certain public bodies. The Ombudsman can investigate administrative action, conduct own-motion investigations, and make recommendations. Ombudsman investigations are free and accessible. Findings aren't binding but carry significant weight. Public interest disclosures (whistleblowing) about government wrongdoing are protected. The Ombudsman's annual reports highlight systemic issues.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Freedom of Information</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's Freedom of Information Act 1992 provides rights to access government documents. Western Australian government agencies, local governments, and statutory authorities are subject to FOI. FOI applications are made in writing. Agencies must respond within 45 days. Exemptions protect cabinet documents, personal privacy, law enforcement, and commercial confidentiality. Information Commissioner reviews FOI decisions. SAT provides further review. FOI promotes government transparency and accountability.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Privacy and Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia doesn't have standalone privacy legislation but public sector agencies are subject to Information Privacy Principles under administrative directions. Personal information must be handled appropriately. Data breaches should be managed appropriately. Privacy lawyers advise government and individuals on privacy rights and obligations under applicable frameworks including federal Privacy Act for some entities.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Government and Public Law</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australian constitutional law governs Parliament, Executive, and Judiciary relationships. The Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1899 establishes Western Australia's constitutional framework. Parliamentary sovereignty, separation of powers, and rule of law are fundamental principles. Statutory interpretation principles guide understanding legislation. Western Australian public lawyers advise government on lawful exercise of power, legislative drafting, and constitutional issues.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Equal Opportunity</h3>
      <p>
        Western Australia's Equal Opportunity Act 1984 prohibits discrimination based on protected attributes including sex, race, age, disability, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The Equal Opportunity Commission investigates complaints and attempts conciliation. Unresolved matters proceed to SAT. Public authorities must eliminate discrimination and promote equal opportunity. Administrative lawyers argue discrimination matters in SAT proceedings.
