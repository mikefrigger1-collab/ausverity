      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Family Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Family law in Victoria operates under federal legislation including the Family Law Act 1975, with state courts handling specific matters such as family violence intervention orders. Victoria has extensive family law resources across Melbourne and regional centres, with the Federal Circuit and Family Court providing comprehensive services for families dealing with separation, divorce, and parenting disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Family Law in Victoria</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian family lawyers handle divorce, property settlements, parenting arrangements, spousal maintenance, and de facto relationship matters. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia operates from Melbourne (Dandenong and Melbourne CBD), Geelong, and Shepparton. Victoria's Magistrates' Court handles family violence intervention orders, which frequently intersect with family law proceedings.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Key Areas of Family Law Practice</h3>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Divorce and Separation</h4>
      <p>
        Divorce in Victoria requires 12 months separation. Separation under one roof is recognized where couples can demonstrate living separately. Victoria has high divorce volumes, particularly in Melbourne. Victorian lawyers assist with divorce applications, address service complications including international service, and handle disputed separation dates. The cooling-off period and mediation requirements apply to protect parties' interests.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Child Custody and Parenting Arrangements</h4>
      <p>
        Parenting matters prioritize children's best interests under the Family Law Act. Victoria encourages parenting plans negotiated between parents without court intervention. When agreement isn't possible, parenting orders address living arrangements, parenting time, parental responsibility, and child support. Victorian courts consider children's views, relationship with both parents, family violence, and the benefit of meaningful relationships. Independent Children's Lawyers are appointed in complex cases.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Property Settlement</h4>
      <p>
        Property settlement involves identifying the asset pool, assessing contributions (financial and non-financial), considering future needs including health and earning capacity, and determining just and equitable division. Melbourne's high property values require expert valuations. Superannuation splitting and complex assets including businesses, trusts, and overseas assets require specialist legal advice. Victorian property settlements often involve sophisticated asset structures.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">De Facto Relationships</h4>
      <p>
        Victoria's relationship property laws largely mirror married couple provisions under federal jurisdiction. De facto couples in Victoria have the same family law rights as married couples if the relationship lasted two years or there are children. Victoria recognizes same-sex de facto relationships. Evidence requirements include cohabitation, financial interdependence, sexual relationship, and social recognition. Disputes about relationship existence are common.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Family Violence Intervention Orders</h4>
      <p>
        Victoria's Family Violence Protection Act 2008 provides for Family Violence Intervention Orders (FVIOs) through Magistrates' Courts. FVIOs protect victims from family violence including physical, sexual, psychological, economic, and coercive control. Police can apply for FVIOs and issue interim orders. Breaching an FVIO is a criminal offence. Victoria has comprehensive family violence support services. Legal aid is available for FVIO matters.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Criminal Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Criminal law in Victoria operates under the Crimes Act 1958, Criminal Procedure Act 2009, and numerous other state and Commonwealth statutes. Victoria has a comprehensive criminal justice system from the Magistrates' Court through to the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. If you're facing criminal charges in Victoria, experienced legal representation is essential to protect your rights and achieve the best possible outcome.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Victorian Criminal Law</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian criminal lawyers defend clients charged with offences ranging from traffic matters to serious indictable crimes. The Magistrates' Court handles summary offences and committal proceedings. The County Court hears most indictable offences including drug trafficking, serious assaults, and sexual offences. The Supreme Court deals with murder, large-scale drug importation, and complex fraud. Victoria's criminal justice system emphasizes rehabilitation alongside punishment.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Criminal Matters</h3>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Drink Driving and Traffic Offences</h4>
      <p>
        Victoria has strict drink driving laws with immediate licence suspensions. Offences include low range (.05-.069), mid-range (.07-.149), high range (.15+), and exceed prescribed content of drugs. Loss of licence mandatory minimum periods apply. Dangerous driving causing death or serious injury carries substantial imprisonment. Diversion programs may be available for first offenders with minor charges. Traffic lawyers challenge testing procedures, apply for limited licenses, and minimize penalties.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Assault and Violence Offences</h4>
      <p>
        Victorian assault charges include common assault, intentionally causing injury, recklessly causing injury, and intentionally/recklessly causing serious injury. Aggravated offences (e.g., in company, with weapons) carry enhanced penalties. One-punch laws create special offences for assaults causing death. Family violence assaults are prosecuted vigorously. Self-defence under section 322K Crimes Act requires reasonable belief that conduct was necessary. Victorian courts consider rehabilitation prospects in sentencing.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Drug Offences</h4>
      <p>
        Victorian drug offences under the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 include possession, trafficking, cultivation, and manufacturing. Traffickable, commercial, and large commercial quantities determine offence severity. Victoria's Drug Court provides intensive supervision and treatment for addicted offenders. The Cannabis Cautioning Program diverts first-time minor possession offenders. Drug lawyers challenge search legality, contest deemed trafficking presumptions, and pursue diversion or treatment options.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Fraud and White Collar Crime</h4>
      <p>
        Fraud in Victoria includes obtaining property by deception, false accounting, identity theft, and computer offences. Victoria Police Fraud and Extortion Squad investigates serious matters. Corporate fraud, ASIC prosecutions, and Centrelink fraud are common. Victorian courts consider restitution and cooperation in sentencing. Complex fraud requires specialist defence lawyers who understand financial transactions and corporate structures.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Sexual Offences</h4>
      <p>
        Sexual assault offences in Victoria carry maximum penalties of 25 years imprisonment, with aggravated circumstances attracting higher penalties. Child abuse material offences are prosecuted extensively. Complainant evidence can be given via CCTV or recorded statements. Sexual assault counselling privilege protects confidential communications. Historical sexual assault prosecutions are common. Specialist criminal lawyers experienced in sexual offence trials are essential for proper defence.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Your Rights When Charged</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian law protects accused persons' rights. You have the right to silence, the right to contact a lawyer before police interview, and the right to refuse participation in identification procedures. Police must caution you before interview. Record of interview procedures must be followed. You're not required to provide anything beyond identifying information. Victoria Legal Aid provides duty lawyer services at police stations and courts.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Court Process in Victoria</h3>
      <p>
        Most criminal matters start at the Magistrates' Court. Summary offences are finalized there. Indictable offences proceed to committal hearings testing the prosecution case before trial at County or Supreme Court. Victoria's Court Integrated Services Program (CISP) provides intensive support and supervision as an alternative to remand. Plea hearings involve detailed submissions on sentencing factors including rehabilitation prospects.

      <p>
        Victorian sentencing follows the Sentencing Act 1991. Penalties include dismissal or discharge without conviction, fines, Community Correction Orders (CCOs), intensive correction orders, and imprisonment. Guilty plea discounts of up to 25% apply for early pleas. Baseline sentencing applies for serious offences. Victorian courts emphasize rehabilitation, with therapeutic courts including Drug Court, CISP, and Koori Court available. Character references, psychological reports, and rehabilitation evidence influence sentencing.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Property Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Property law in Victoria operates under the Sale of Land Act 1962, Transfer of Land Act 1958, and numerous other statutes. Melbourne's property market is among Australia's most active, with Victoria's property transactions involving complex legal requirements. Victorian property lawyers ensure smooth conveyancing, protect your interests, and navigate Victoria's unique property law framework.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Conveyancing in Victoria</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian conveyancing involves contract exchange, cooling-off period (3 business days for buyers on standard contracts), building and pest inspections, settlement, and registration. Section 32 Vendor Statements must disclose property information. Electronic conveyancing through PEXA is mandatory. Victoria's land tax and transfer duty (stamp duty) apply with various concessions available. Searches reveal council rates, planning restrictions, and title encumbrances.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Residential Property Transactions</h3>
      <p>
        Buying property in Victoria requires careful attention to Section 32 Vendor Statements, building inspections, and contract terms. The cooling-off period allows buyers to withdraw with 0.2% penalty. Off-the-plan purchases have special protections including sunset clauses. Melbourne's property market requires expert legal advice on contract negotiation. First home buyers can access stamp duty exemptions and concessions for properties under certain values.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">First Home Buyers in Victoria</h4>
      <p>
        Victoria offers first home buyer concessions including full stamp duty exemption for properties up to $600,000 and reduced duty up to $750,000. The First Home Owner Grant provides $10,000 for newly built or substantially renovated homes. Regional Victoria may have additional benefits. HomesVic assists eligible first home buyers. Your property lawyer ensures you receive all available concessions and proper Section 32 disclosure.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Commercial Property</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian commercial property transactions involve complex due diligence on leases, environmental issues, GST, and business operations. Commercial contracts have shorter cooling-off periods and different disclosure requirements. Lease assignments require landlord consent under the Retail Leases Act 2003. Melbourne CBD commercial property has unique considerations including building classifications and development potential. Commercial property lawyers conduct comprehensive due diligence and negotiate favorable terms.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Leasing and Tenancy</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Residential Tenancies Act 1997 governs residential tenancies. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) resolves tenancy disputes including bond claims, repairs, and termination. Recent reforms provide greater tenant protections including minimum standards, limits on rent increases, and restrictions on evictions. Retail leases under the Retail Leases Act 2003 require comprehensive disclosure and minimum five-year terms for most leases.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Owners Corporations and Strata</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Owners Corporation Act 2006 governs apartments and townhouses. Owners corporations manage common property, levy collection, and rule enforcement. Owners corporation certificates disclose financial position, rules, major works, and disputes. Building defects in new developments are addressed through builders' warranties and statutory warranties. VCAT resolves owners corporation disputes including rule breaches and building defects.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Property Development</h3>
      <p>
        Property development in Victoria requires planning permits from local councils under the Planning and Environment Act 1987. The permit process assesses development against planning schemes and state planning policies. VCAT hears planning appeals. Victorian planning law is complex with significant case law development. Development contribution plans, Section 173 agreements, and infrastructure contributions apply to larger developments. Planning lawyers coordinate applications, appeals, and compliance.

  'wills-estates': (

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Wills and Estates Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Wills and estates law in Victoria is governed by the Wills Act 1997, Administration and Probate Act 1958, and Powers of Attorney Act 2014. Proper estate planning protects your assets, provides for loved ones, and minimizes disputes. Victorian wills and estates lawyers provide comprehensive advice on succession planning, estate administration, and contesting wills.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Will Drafting in Victoria</h3>
      <p>
        A valid Victorian will must be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by two independent witnesses who sign in the testator's presence. Informal wills can be admitted to probate in limited circumstances under section 9A Wills Act. Professional will drafting addresses blended families, business succession, asset protection, and tax planning. Testamentary trusts protect beneficiaries from bankruptcy, relationship breakdowns, and provide tax benefits. Regular reviews ensure wills reflect changed circumstances.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Estate Planning Strategies</h3>
      <p>
        Comprehensive estate planning in Victoria includes wills, enduring powers of attorney (financial and medical treatment), advance care directives, and superannuation binding death benefit nominations. Proper planning minimizes family provision claims, provides for disabled beneficiaries through special disability trusts, and structures inheritances for asset protection. Melbourne's high property values make estate planning particularly important for managing wealth transfer and tax efficiency.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Probate and Estate Administration</h3>
      <p>
        Probate is the Supreme Court's grant of representation to executors. Victorian executors must collect assets, pay debts, lodge tax returns, and distribute to beneficiaries according to the will. Small estates under certain thresholds may use the Resealing procedure. The process involves obtaining death certificate, locating the will, identifying assets and liabilities, obtaining valuations, and preparing estate accounts. Lawyers ensure executors comply with duties and protect against personal liability.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Intestacy in Victoria</h4>
      <p>
        When someone dies without a valid will, intestacy rules under Part IV Administration and Probate Act determine distribution. Spouses receive priority with provisions for children. The intestacy formula considers family composition. Domestic partners have the same rights as married spouses. The State Trustees may be appointed administrator if no family applies. Intestacy often results in unintended outcomes and family disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Contesting Wills and Family Provision Claims</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's family provision regime under Part IV Administration and Probate Act allows eligible persons to apply for greater provision from an estate. Eligible persons include spouses, children (including adult children), domestic partners, stepchildren, and registered caring partners. Applications must be filed within six months of probate grant. Victorian courts consider financial resources, health, relationship with deceased, contributions, and provision made. Successful claims significantly alter distributions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Powers of Attorney</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria recognizes enduring powers of attorney (financial), enduring powers of attorney (medical treatment), and general powers of attorney. Enduring powers must be properly executed with witnesses and continue after loss of capacity. Attorneys must act in the principal's best interests, keep proper accounts, and avoid conflicts of interest. VCAT reviews attorney conduct and suspected financial abuse. Registration may be required for property transactions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Medical Treatment Decision Making</h3>
      <p>
        Enduring powers of attorney (medical treatment) allow appointed persons to make medical decisions if you lose capacity. Appointments must be witnessed by two authorized witnesses. Advance care directives document your medical treatment preferences. Victoria's Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 provides the framework. VCAT's Guardianship List can appoint guardians for medical decisions if you lose capacity without valid appointments.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Employment Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Employment law in Victoria operates primarily under federal legislation including the Fair Work Act 2009, with state-based workers compensation and workplace safety laws. Victoria has extensive employment law resources including the Fair Work Commission, Victorian WorkCover Authority, and WorkSafe Victoria. Employment lawyers protect employee and employer rights in this complex regulatory environment.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Employment Law in Victoria</h3>
      <p>
        Most Victorian employment matters fall under the federal Fair Work system covering minimum wages, working conditions, unfair dismissal, and general protections. However, Victorian state laws govern workers compensation through WorkSafe Victoria, workplace safety under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004, and certain public sector employment matters. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal handles some employment disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Unfair Dismissal Claims</h3>
      <p>
        Employees dismissed from employment may file unfair dismissal applications with the Fair Work Commission if they've served the minimum employment period (six months for small businesses, 12 months otherwise) and earn below the high income threshold. Applications must be lodged within 21 days of dismissal. Victorian employment lawyers assess dismissal fairness, prepare applications, and represent clients at conciliation conferences and hearings. Remedies include reinstatement or compensation up to six months' wages.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">General Protections Claims</h4>
      <p>
        General protections prohibit adverse action for exercising workplace rights, union membership, discrimination, or sham contracting. These claims have 60-day time limits but can result in uncapped compensation. Victoria has significant case law on general protections particularly regarding COVID-19 related terminations and vaccine mandate disputes. Anti-bullying applications can be made to Fair Work Commission while still employed.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Workplace Discrimination and Harassment</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Equal Opportunity Act 2010 prohibits discrimination based on protected attributes including age, disability, employment activity, gender identity, industrial activity, marital status, parental status, physical features, political belief, pregnancy, race, religious belief, sex, sexual orientation, and personal association. The Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission investigates complaints and attempts conciliation. Unresolved matters proceed to VCAT. Sexual harassment reforms have strengthened protections and employer obligations.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Employment Contracts and Agreements</h3>
      <p>
        Employment lawyers review and draft employment contracts, executive service agreements, restraint of trade clauses, confidentiality agreements, and enterprise agreements. Victorian courts have developed significant case law on restraint of trade enforceability, requiring restraints to protect legitimate business interests and be reasonable. Post-employment restraints are frequently litigated in Victorian Supreme Court, particularly in professional services and technology sectors.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Workers' Compensation</h3>
      <p>
        WorkSafe Victoria administers workers compensation for Victorian workers. Claims cover medical expenses, weekly payments, impairment benefits, and common law damages for work injuries. Victorian workers can pursue common law damages where employer negligence caused serious injury (significant impairment threshold). Time limits apply - workers compensation claims should be lodged promptly, common law claims within three years. Lawyers maximize both statutory and common law entitlements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Redundancy and Restructuring</h3>
      <p>
        Genuine redundancy requires the position to no longer exist. Large-scale redundancies may require consultation under Fair Work Act provisions. Redundancy pay depends on years of service. Victorian employees can challenge sham redundancies or unfair selection processes. Victorian public sector redundancies have specific provisions under the Public Administration Act 2004. Employment lawyers ensure proper processes and maximum entitlements.

      <p>
        WorkSafe Victoria enforces Victoria's Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004, including psychosocial hazards and workplace bullying. Victorian employers must provide safe systems of work and address workplace bullying. The Fair Work Commission handles workplace bullying applications. Workers compensation claims for psychological injury from workplace bullying are common. Employment lawyers advise on prevention, responding to complaints, and defending claims.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Personal Injury Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Personal injury law in Victoria helps victims of accidents and negligence obtain compensation. Victoria operates comprehensive compensation schemes including Transport Accident Commission (TAC) for motor accidents, WorkSafe Victoria for workplace injuries, and common law claims for public liability and medical negligence. Experienced Victorian personal injury lawyers navigate these schemes to maximize your compensation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Transport Accidents</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Transport Accident Commission (TAC) provides no-fault compensation for injuries in transport accidents involving cars, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, and other road users. TAC covers medical treatment, income support, and attendant care regardless of fault. For more serious injuries, common law damages claims provide additional compensation for pain and suffering, economic loss, and gratuitous care. The serious injury threshold requires significant injury or impairment percentage. Claims must be lodged within specific timeframes.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">TAC Benefits and Common Law Claims</h4>
      <p>
        All injured persons receive TAC benefits including medical treatment, income replacement, attendant care, and travel expenses. These benefits continue as needed. Common law damages require meeting the serious injury threshold - either narrative test (significant injury) or impairment test (over 30% whole person impairment). Personal injury lawyers ensure maximum TAC benefits and assess common law prospects. Victoria's modified common law system balances compensation with scheme sustainability.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Medical Negligence</h3>
      <p>
        Medical negligence claims in Victoria arise from substandard medical care causing injury. This includes misdiagnosis, surgical errors, medication mistakes, birth injuries, and failure to obtain informed consent. Victorian public hospitals are covered by the Victorian Managed Insurance Authority, while private practitioners have professional indemnity insurance. The Wrongs Act 1958 governs liability and damages. Expert medical evidence is essential. Time limits are generally three years from awareness of negligence.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Public Liability Claims</h3>
      <p>
        Public liability claims compensate injuries on another person's property or due to their negligence. Common claims include slip and fall in shopping centres, council property injuries, dog attacks, and defective products. Victoria's Wrongs Act 1958 requires proving breach of duty of care and causation. Contributory negligence reduces compensation if you were partly at fault. Dangerous recreational activities may have limited liability. Personal injury lawyers investigate liability and negotiate with insurers.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">WorkCover Claims</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian workers injured at work claim WorkCover through WorkSafe Victoria for medical expenses, weekly payments, and impairment benefits. For serious injuries caused by employer negligence, common law damages claims provide substantially higher compensation. The serious injury test requires significant injury or permanent impairment over 30%. Time limits are strict - WorkCover claims should be lodged immediately, common law claims within three years. Specialist lawyers assess both statutory and common law entitlements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Total and Permanent Disability (TPD)</h3>
      <p>
        TPD insurance, typically held through superannuation, pays lump sum benefits when unable to work due to injury or illness. Victorian TPD claims are common, with insurers frequently denying legitimate claims. Disputes involve medical evidence, policy interpretation, and TPD definitions. The Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) handles complaints. TPD lawyers represent claimants through the claims and appeals process.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Dust Diseases and Asbestos</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian workers exposed to asbestos, silica, or other harmful dusts can develop serious diseases decades later. Asbestos-related diseases including mesothelioma, asbestosis, and asbestos-related lung cancer have special compensation provisions. WorkSafe Victoria administers workers compensation for dust diseases. Common law claims against former employers and asbestos product manufacturers provide additional compensation. Time limits are extended due to long latency periods. Specialist asbestos lawyers trace exposure history.

Medical panels determine impairment percentages. Most claims settle through negotiation or alternative dispute resolution. Supreme Court litigation is reserved for complex or high-value disputes. Personal injury lawyers guide clients through dispute resolution processes.

      <p>
        Choosing the right business structure is crucial. Options include sole trader, partnership, trust, or company. Companies are regulated by ASIC under the Corporations Act 2001. Victorian lawyers advise on tax implications, asset protection, liability, succession planning, and compliance requirements. Company incorporation involves registration with ASIC, constitution drafting, shareholder agreements, and compliance frameworks. Trusts require careful structuring to achieve tax and asset protection benefits.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Commercial Contracts</h3>
      <p>
        Commercial contracts underpin Victorian businesses. Common contracts include supply agreements, distribution agreements, service agreements, licensing, franchise agreements, and joint ventures.

Lawyers draft, review, and negotiate contracts protecting your business interests and ensuring enforceability.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Franchising</h4>
      <p>
        Franchising in Victoria is regulated by the Franchising Code of Conduct requiring comprehensive disclosure before franchise sale.

      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mergers and Acquisitions</h3>
      <p>
        Business acquisitions in Victoria involve due diligence, contract negotiation, regulatory approvals, and completion. Due diligence examines financial records, contracts, litigation, intellectual property, employment, and tax. Share sales transfer ownership of the company entity. Asset sales transfer specific business assets. Earn-out provisions, warranties, and indemnities protect buyers. Competition law clearance may be required. Corporate lawyers coordinate complex acquisitions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Partnership and Shareholder Agreements</h3>
      <p>
        Partnership agreements govern business partnerships under the Partnership Act 1958. Shareholder agreements regulate relationships between company shareholders addressing management, share transfers, dispute resolution, and exit strategies. Buy-sell provisions, drag-along and tag-along rights, and valuation mechanisms prevent deadlocks. Victorian Supreme Court handles partnership and shareholder disputes including oppression claims under section 232 Corporations Act. Proper agreements prevent costly disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Commercial Disputes</h3>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Immigration Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Immigration law in Victoria operates under federal legislation including the Migration Act 1958 and Migration Regulations. Melbourne is Australia's fastest-growing major city with significant migration. Victoria attracts skilled migrants, international students, family migrants, and business migrants. Registered migration agents and immigration lawyers guide applicants through complex visa processes and represent clients in tribunals and courts.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Visa Categories</h3>
      <p>
        Australia's visa system includes temporary visas (visitor, student, temporary work) and permanent visas (skilled, family, business). Victoria's state nomination program for skilled migrants provides pathways to permanent residence. Melbourne's diverse economy creates opportunities across multiple occupations. Visa applications require meeting health, character, and specific visa criteria. Processing times vary significantly by visa type and applicant circumstances.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Skilled Migration</h4>
      <p>
        Skilled migration to Victoria includes independent skilled visas, state-nominated visas, and employer-sponsored visas. Victoria's state nomination program targets occupations in demand including healthcare, education, engineering, and IT. Points-tested visas require meeting points threshold through age, English, qualifications, and work experience. Skills assessments verify qualifications meet Australian standards. Employer sponsorship requires approved sponsor status and labor market testing.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Family Migration</h3>
      <p>
        Partner visas allow Australian citizens, permanent residents, and eligible New Zealand citizens to sponsor spouses and de facto partners. Prospective marriage visas require intent to marry within nine months. Parent visas have long waiting periods with contributory options providing faster processing. Child visas and remaining relative visas complete family migration categories. Victoria's multicultural population makes family reunification common.

Ministerial intervention under sections 48B, 351, or 417 provides last resort options. Bridging visas allow lawful stay while matters are resolved. Detention reviews are available through the Administrative Review Tribunal. Immigration lawyers urgently respond to detention and deportation matters.

  'bankruptcy-insolvency': (

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Bankruptcy and Insolvency in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Bankruptcy and insolvency law in Victoria helps individuals and companies facing financial difficulties. The Bankruptcy Act 1966 governs personal insolvency, while the Corporations Act 2001 governs corporate insolvency. Victoria has experienced insolvency practitioners and lawyers who advise on bankruptcy alternatives, restructuring, and formal insolvency processes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Personal Bankruptcy</h3>
      <p>
        Bankruptcy is a formal process where an individual is declared unable to pay debts. Bankruptcy can be voluntary (debtor's petition) or involuntary (creditor's petition). A trustee takes control of assets, realizes them, and distributes to creditors. Bankruptcy typically lasts three years. During bankruptcy, travel restrictions apply, credit reporting continues for five years, and certain assets are protected including household items, tools of trade, and some superannuation. Bankruptcy discharges most debts excluding child support, HECS, and fraud debts.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Alternatives to Bankruptcy</h4>
      <p>
        Debt agreements under Part IX Bankruptcy Act allow debtors to propose reduced payment arrangements to creditors avoiding bankruptcy. Personal insolvency agreements (Part X) provide flexible arrangements for higher-value estates. Informal arrangements negotiate payment plans with creditors. These alternatives avoid bankruptcy's consequences while addressing debt. Victorian insolvency practitioners assess options and implement solutions. Early advice maximizes options and prevents forced bankruptcy.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Corporate Insolvency</h3>
      <p>
        Companies facing insolvency have several options. Voluntary administration under Part 5.3A Corporations Act provides breathing space while administrators investigate rescue prospects. Creditors vote on proposals including deeds of company arrangement. Liquidation winds up companies and distributes assets to creditors. Receivers can be appointed by secured creditors. Directors facing insolvent trading allegations face personal liability. Early advice prevents wrongful trading and maximizes restructuring options.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Liquidation</h3>
      <p>
        Liquidation ends company existence through voluntary liquidation (members' or creditors') or court-ordered winding up. Liquidators realize assets, investigate company affairs, and distribute to creditors according to priority. Employees rank ahead of unsecured creditors for wages and entitlements. Liquidators pursue voidable transactions including unfair preferences and uncommercial transactions. ASIC regulates liquidators. Creditors receive dividends if assets remain after secured and priority creditors.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Voluntary Administration</h3>
      <p>
        Voluntary administration provides companies with temporary protection from creditors while exploring rescue options. Administrators investigate company affairs and report to creditors on prospects of saving business. Creditors vote on proposals including deeds of company arrangement, liquidation, or returning company to directors. Victorian administrators work with directors, creditors, and employees to achieve optimal outcomes. Administration can result in successful restructuring saving businesses and jobs.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Creditors' Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Creditors can initiate bankruptcy or winding up proceedings to recover debts. Statutory demands under section 459E Corporations Act require companies to pay debts or face presumed insolvency. Creditors lodge proofs of debt in administrations and liquidations. Committees of inspection represent creditor interests. Creditors can challenge administrators' and liquidators' decisions. Security interests under the Personal Property Securities Act provide priority. Insolvency lawyers represent creditors maximizing recoveries.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Directors' Duties and Insolvent Trading</h3>
      <p>
        Directors must prevent insolvent trading - incurring debts when company cannot pay them. Section 588G Corporations Act imposes personal liability on directors for insolvent trading. Safe harbour protections apply when directors develop and implement restructuring plans. The business judgment rule protects informed, good faith decisions. ASIC prosecutes serious director breaches. Victorian insolvency lawyers advise directors on duties, safe harbour, and defending claims.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Intellectual Property Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Intellectual property law protects creations of the mind including inventions, brands, designs, and creative works. Victoria's innovation economy, particularly in Melbourne's technology and creative sectors, makes IP protection essential. Victorian IP lawyers advise on registration, protection, commercialization, and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Trademarks</h3>
      <p>
        Trademarks protect brand names, logos, and other identifiers under the Trade Marks Act 1995. Registration with IP Australia provides exclusive rights to use marks for registered goods and services. Victorian businesses should conduct searches before adoption, register in relevant classes, and monitor for infringement. Trademark protection prevents consumer confusion and protects brand investment. Opposition and cancellation proceedings defend trademark rights. Lawyers advise on selection, registration, and enforcement.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Copyright</h3>
      <p>
        Copyright automatically protects original works including literary works, artistic works, music, films, sound recordings, and broadcasts under the Copyright Act 1968. Protection lasts life of author plus 70 years. Copyright protects expression, not ideas. Fair dealing exceptions allow limited use for research, criticism, and news reporting. Digital copyright issues are increasingly important. Copyright assignment and licensing agreements commercialize works. Infringement remedies include damages, accounts of profits, and injunctions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Patents</h3>
      <p>
        Patents protect inventions that are novel, inventive, and useful under the Patents Act 1990. Standard patents last 20 years; innovation patents (abolished 2021 for new applications) lasted 8 years. The patent process involves search, application, examination, and grant. Provisional applications establish priority for 12 months. Victorian innovation in medical devices, software, and manufacturing generates significant patent activity. Patent lawyers conduct searches, draft specifications, prosecute applications, and enforce patents.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Designs</h3>
      <p>
        Registered designs protect visual appearance of products including shape, configuration, pattern, and ornamentation under the Designs Act 2003. Protection lasts up to 10 years. Designs must be new and distinctive. Registration is relatively quick and affordable. Product designers and manufacturers should register designs before public disclosure. Design infringement involves making, importing, or selling products embodying registered designs. Victorian product design industries benefit from design protection.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Trade Secrets and Confidential Information</h3>
      <p>
        Trade secrets protect confidential business information including formulas, processes, customer lists, and know-how. Unlike registered IP rights, trade secrets rely on maintaining secrecy. Breach of confidence claims prevent unauthorized disclosure or use. Employment contracts and non-disclosure agreements protect confidential information. Victorian courts grant injunctions preventing disclosure and damages for breaches. IP lawyers draft protection agreements and pursue breaches.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">IP Commercialization</h3>
      <p>
        IP commercialization includes licensing, assignment, and joint ventures. Licensing agreements grant rights to use IP while retaining ownership. Exclusive licenses provide sole licensee rights; non-exclusive licenses permit multiple licensees. Royalty structures compensate IP owners. Due diligence examines IP ownership and validity. R&D tax incentives support Victorian innovation. IP lawyers negotiate and draft commercialization agreements maximizing value while protecting rights.

        IP infringement is enforced through Federal Court proceedings. Remedies include injunctions, damages, accounts of profits, and delivery up of infringing goods. Australian Border Force can seize counterfeit imports. Anton Piller orders (search orders) preserve evidence. Cease and desist letters often resolve matters without litigation. Victorian IP owners should actively monitor and enforce rights. Lawyers advise on infringement, conduct negotiations, and litigate when necessary.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Tax Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Tax law in Victoria encompasses federal taxation administered by the Australian Taxation Office and state taxes administered by the State Revenue Office Victoria. Victorian tax lawyers advise individuals and businesses on tax planning, compliance, disputes, and restructuring to minimize tax liabilities and resolve ATO disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Income Tax</h3>
      <p>
        Income tax applies to individuals, companies, trusts, and superannuation funds under federal tax law. Victorian taxpayers face the same income tax rates as other Australians. Tax planning includes structuring income, maximizing deductions, timing transactions, and utilizing concessions. Small business CGT concessions provide significant relief for business asset sales. Negative gearing remains important for Victorian property investors despite periodic policy debates. Tax lawyers advise on complex transactions, restructures, and ATO audits.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Goods and Services Tax (GST)</h4>
      <p>
        GST at 10% applies to most supplies of goods and services. Businesses with turnover over $75,000 ($150,000 for non-profits) must register. Input tax credits allow GST-registered businesses to claim back GST on purchases. GST-free supplies include basic food, health, and education. Complex GST issues arise in property transactions, financial supplies, and margin schemes. Victorian property developments involve significant GST considerations. Tax advisers ensure GST compliance and optimal structuring.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">State Taxes - Stamp Duty and Land Tax</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria imposes stamp duty (transfer duty) on property transfers, business asset sales, motor vehicle transfers, and insurance. Rates vary by transaction type. Property stamp duty uses progressive rates with first home buyer concessions. Land tax applies annually to Victorian land holdings above thresholds with aggregation rules. Principal place of residence exemption excludes main homes. Trusts face surcharges. State Revenue Office Victoria administers these taxes with objection and appeal rights to VCAT and Supreme Court.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Payroll Tax</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian employers with wages exceeding the threshold ($700,000 for 2023-24) pay payroll tax at 4.85%. Grouping provisions aggregate related businesses' wages. Contractors may be deemed employees for payroll tax. Regional employers receive rate reductions. SRO audits ensure compliance. Voluntary disclosures provide penalty relief. Tax lawyers advise on payroll tax obligations, grouping, and disputes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tax Disputes and Audits</h3>
      <p>
        ATO audits examine tax returns for compliance. Taxpayers have rights including representation and reasonable time to respond. Objections challenge ATO decisions with 60-day time limits (four years for small businesses). The Administrative Review Tribunal reviews objection decisions. Federal Court hears appeals on questions of law. Victorian taxpayers frequently dispute Part IVA general anti-avoidance provisions, transfer pricing, and thin capitalization. Tax lawyers represent clients in audits, objections, and litigation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tax Planning and Restructuring</h3>
      <p>
        Tax planning minimizes tax within legal boundaries. Common strategies include income splitting through family trusts, superannuation contributions, negative gearing, and asset protection structures. Business restructures utilize rollover provisions avoiding immediate tax. Victorian businesses expanding interstate consider federal vs. state tax implications. Voluntary disclosures to ATO reduce penalties for past non-compliance. Tax lawyers design compliant structures achieving tax efficiency.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Environmental Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Environmental law in Victoria regulates environmental protection, land use planning, and natural resource management. The Environment Protection Act 2017 provides Victoria's modern environmental framework with the Environment Protection Authority Victoria as principal regulator. Victorian environmental lawyers advise on compliance, planning, contaminated land, climate change, and environmental litigation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Environment Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Environment Protection Act 2017 implements a general environmental duty requiring all persons to minimize environmental risks. The EPA Victoria issues environmental reference standards and permissions. Industrial premises require EPA licenses or permits. Pollution incidents must be reported. EPA can issue improvement notices, prohibition notices, and environmental audits. Prosecution for serious breaches carries significant penalties. Environmental lawyers advise on duty compliance and respond to EPA action.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Planning and Development</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Planning and Environment Act 1987 regulates land use and development. Planning schemes (state and local) control development through zones, overlays, and provisions. Planning permits are required for most development. Councils assess applications against planning schemes. VCAT reviews permit refusals and appeals. Major projects can access streamlined assessment. Environmental effects may require environmental effects statements. Planning lawyers obtain permits, defend objections, and appeal decisions.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Contaminated Land</h4>
      <p>
        Contaminated land creates liability for current and former owners, occupiers, and polluters. EPA maintains contaminated land register. Environmental audits under Environment Protection Act certify land as suitable for use. Section 53V certificates provide protection for new owners. Due diligence investigations identify contamination risks. Cleanup costs can be substantial. Environmental lawyers advise purchasers, vendors, and responsible parties on contaminated land issues.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Native Title and Cultural Heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Native title recognizes Indigenous rights to traditional lands. Native title claims in Victoria are determined by Federal Court. Aboriginal Victoria administers Victoria's Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage. Cultural heritage management plans are required for high-impact activities. Traditional owners must be consulted. Unauthorized harm to Aboriginal heritage is an offence. Developers engage with traditional owner groups and obtain cultural heritage permits.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mining and Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Mining in Victoria requires licenses under the Mineral Resources (Sustainable Development) Act 1990. Earth Resources Regulation regulates mining and extractive industries. Work plans address environmental management. Rehabilitation bonds ensure site restoration. Victorian coal, gold, and construction materials industries are significant. The permanent ban on unconventional gas (fracking) prohibits certain activities. Mining lawyers obtain approvals and advise on compliance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Climate Change and Renewable Energy</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria has ambitious renewable energy and emissions reduction targets. The Climate Change Act 2017 establishes net zero by 2050 target. Victorian Renewable Energy Target drives wind and solar development. Planning reforms facilitate renewable energy projects. National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting requires emissions reporting. Carbon farming opportunities exist. Climate litigation is emerging. Environmental lawyers advise on renewable energy projects, climate governance, and regulatory compliance.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Administrative Law in Victoria</h2>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-700 mb-6">
        Administrative law in Victoria governs the exercise of government power and review of government decisions. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), Ombudsman Victoria, and courts review administrative action. Administrative lawyers challenge unlawful decisions, ensure procedural fairness, and hold government accountable to the rule of law.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">VCAT Review</h3>
      <p>
        VCAT reviews state government decisions across diverse areas including planning, building, tenancy, guardianship, occupational regulation, and discrimination. VCAT provides accessible, low-cost review with less formality than courts. The enabling Act for each decision specifies review rights and grounds. VCAT conducts hearings de novo, reconsidering matters afresh. Lawyers represent parties in VCAT proceedings, ensuring procedural rights and presenting persuasive cases.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Judicial Review</h3>
      <p>
        Judicial review challenges government decisions on legal grounds including jurisdictional error, procedural unfairness, taking irrelevant considerations into account, failing to consider relevant matters, and unreasonableness. The Supreme Court's judicial review jurisdiction covers Victorian government decisions. Federal Court reviews Commonwealth decisions. Judicial review doesn't substitute decision-maker's discretion but ensures lawful exercise. Remedies include quashing decisions, mandamus compelling action, and declarations.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">Procedural Fairness</h4>
      <p>
        Procedural fairness (natural justice) requires fair hearing and unbiased decision-makers. The hearing rule requires notice, opportunity to be heard, and consideration of submissions. The bias rule requires actual or apprehended freedom from bias. Victorian decision-makers must comply unless legislation clearly excludes fairness. Lawyers challenge decisions lacking procedural fairness and advise government on compliance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Ombudsman Victoria</h3>
      <p>
        Ombudsman Victoria investigates complaints about Victorian government agencies, local councils, and certain public bodies. The Ombudsman can investigate administrative action, conduct own-motion investigations, and make recommendations. Ombudsman investigations are free and accessible. Findings aren't binding but carry significant weight. Protected disclosures (whistleblowing) about government wrongdoing are protected. The Ombudsman's annual reports highlight systemic issues.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Freedom of Information</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Freedom of Information Act 1982 provides rights to access government documents. Victorian government agencies, local councils, and statutory authorities are subject to FOI. FOI requests are made in writing. Agencies must respond within 30 days. Exemptions protect cabinet documents, personal privacy, law enforcement, and commercial confidentiality. OVIC (Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner) reviews FOI decisions. VCAT provides further review. FOI promotes government transparency and accountability.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Privacy and Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 regulates Victorian public sector information handling. Information Privacy Principles govern collection, use, disclosure, and security of personal information. OVIC enforces privacy law and investigates complaints. Data breaches must be notified. Victorian health services comply with the Health Records Act 2001. The Commissioner can make binding determinations. Privacy lawyers advise government and complainants on privacy rights and obligations.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Government and Public Law</h3>
      <p>
        Victorian constitutional law governs Parliament, Executive, and Judiciary relationships. The Constitution Act 1975 establishes Victoria's constitutional framework. Parliamentary sovereignty, separation of powers, and rule of law are fundamental principles. Statutory interpretation principles guide understanding legislation. Victorian public lawyers advise government on lawful exercise of power, legislative drafting, and constitutional issues.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">Human Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria's Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 protects fundamental rights including equality, liberty, fair hearing, and privacy. Public authorities must act compatibly with human rights and consider human rights in decisions. Courts interpret legislation compatibly with rights where possible. Declarations of inconsistent interpretation don't invalidate laws but prompt parliamentary reconsideration. The Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission promotes rights. Administrative lawyers argue human rights in judicial review and VCAT proceedings.
